# Intro

This year we, again, signed up for a robotic competiton with lego Ev3 robots. It's already the second time when we take part in this event, so we have some experience and know-how.
Speaking about the competiton, maybe it would be nice to include its name and link there:

# Main Idea

If you read the rules and you know us then you must come to a conclusion that we will no matter what want to have a 100% rating. So how do we start?
Firstly, we will drive the robot in a spiral to colect all the ping pong balls that we get point for. Secondly, we're gonna collect the rest of the balls and then dump them at the oppents half of the game map.
